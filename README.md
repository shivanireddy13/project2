# An Analysis of Formula One 2022's Best Race
This project visualizes the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2022. 

## Summary 
This data is my attempt to understand a race weekend that was thrilling to experience. I visualized some of its best moments, including Kevin Magnussen's shock pole, Hamilton and Verstappen's collision and Russell's win.

## Data Collection & Analysis
I used the fastf1 API and its extensive documentation on graphing race telemetry to collect data about the Brazil, 2022, Q and R sessions. I cleaned the data I acquired minimally in Pandas, and then plotted it using ggplot, matplotlib and seaborn. I cleaned up the graphs I made further in Adobe Illustrator.

## What I could've done better
There were so many more moments I wanted to get to. I also hope to improve my Illustrator skills so there's more consistency from graph to graph. I wanted to add sector by sector data to my charts (every Formula 1 track is divided into three sectors) but neither API nor the official Formula ONe website have sector lengths. I looked for hours! I'm not sure why that information is not public. I think it would be fairly simple (for others, not for me) to calculate an average number based on the racing line that drivers take around the track. It would helped with explaining where crashes or overtakes happened.
I also want to get better at predictive modeling so I can make educated guesses towards questions like "Would Driver 1 have won the race if Driver 2 had second-longer pitstop?" or "Would Driver 3 have retained 4th place in the championship if they had not spun on lap 45?" and other such hypotheticals.
