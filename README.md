# An Analysis of Formula One 2022's Best Race
This project visualizes the Brazilian Grand Prix 2022. 

## Summary 
This data is my attempt to understand a race weekend that was thrilling to experience. I visualized some of its best moments, including Kevin Magnussen's shock pole, Hamilton and Verstappen's collision and Russell's win.

## Data Collection & Analysis
I used the fastf1 API and its extensive documentation on graphing race telemetry to collect data about the Brazil, 2022, Q and R sessions. I cleaned the data I acquired minimally in Pandas, and then plotted it using ggplot, matplotlib and seaborn. I cleaned up the graphs I made further in Adobe Illustrator.

## Tools used (and skills gained)
<ul>Fast F1 API
<ul>Pandas</ul>
<ul>Jupyter Notebook</ul>
<ul>GGPlot</ul>
<ul>Matplotlib</ul>
<ul>Seaborn</ul>
<ul>HTML</ul>
<ul>CSS</ul> 

## What I could've done better
There were so many more moments I wanted to get to. I also hope to improve my Illustrator skills so there's more consistency from graph to graph. I also want to get better at predictive modeling so I can make educated guesses towards questions like "Would Driver 1 have won the race if Driver 2 had second-longer pitstop?" or "Would Driver 3 have retained 4th place in the championship if they had not spun on lap 45?" and other such hypotheticals.
