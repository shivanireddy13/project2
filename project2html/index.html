        <p> The 2022 Brazil Grand Prix was held on a cloudy summer afternoon in Sao Paulo's Interlagos circuit. In a largely predictable and uneventful season, the race stood out by a long shot. A driver in the slowest team put his car in first place and then was crashed into in the first lap, title rivals collided not once but twice, and a young driver cinched his first race win. Here are some of those moments visualized.

        <p> Kevin Magnussen drives for team Haas. Haas has consistently been in the bottom 3 teams since they started racing in 2016, save for a brilliant 5th place in 2015. While they started the 2022 season strong, their performance tapered as the year went on, for a number of reasons: other teams brought upgrades, and Haas, a lower-budget team, couldn't afford to keep up. This pole was definitely essential. Magnussen skillfully drove on dry-weather tires in drizzly weather, while others opted for intermediate tyres. This gave him the advantage, especially over Max Verstappen (VER), who put up a good fight but was in the end two-tenths slower than Magnussen. Magnussen therefore secured Haas a spot on the front row, both the team's and his first pole position.  </p>

        <p> Here are the states where most name changes happened. My home state, Karnataka, is in the lead here, with 12 name changes, all of which took place in 2007. Bangalore changed to Bengaluru. Mysore changed to Mysuru. Likewise, in other states, cities were re-spelled in the transliterated form of the regional dialect as opposed to the transliteration of the way the British preferred to pronounce city names. In Tamil Nadu, Conjevaram became Kanchipuram, and in West Bengal, Calcutta became Kolkata. </p>

        <p> But many old names persist. I attribute it to a national sense of stubborness towards change. Many still refer to Mumbai as Bombay, for example, a name whose origin can be traced back to the port city's Portuguese colonizers. They named the city 'Bom Bahia' or 'Bombaim' which means 'the beautiful bays.' High Courts in different cities still go by the city's old name, like 'Bangalore High Court' in my city, or 'Madras High Court' in Chennai.
